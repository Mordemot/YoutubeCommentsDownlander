Simple python script to scrap all coments from youtube video.
It's also my first project so code is probably bad.

If for some wierd reason u want use that here's what to do:
In console(I'm using linux but for windows will probably work in the same way) install these package:
pip install selenium
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install webdriver-manager

Then run code in console:
python main.py
